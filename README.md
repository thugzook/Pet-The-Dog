# PetTheDog-Unity

## Objective
Pet Bartholomew the dog whilst avoiding the various obstacles and dangers in your way. Most importantly, avoid the watchful gaze of his owner or pay the consequences...

## Description
My first foray into the world of game development, Unity and C#, **Pet the Dog** is my very first personal project seen to completion.
It features hand drawn art, dynamic instance generation and a loving dog. I created this project as a gift for my SO (spoiler alert: she loved it!).

## Features
* Wacky, stretchy arms (generated through dynamic instances and a lot of math)
* Hand-drawn art
* A loving dog

## Results
This project introduced me to both the Unity design pattern and C#.
