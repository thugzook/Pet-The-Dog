# PetTheDog-Unity

## Objective
Pet Bartholomew the dog whilst avoiding the various obstacles and dangers in your way. Most importantly, avoid the watchful gaze of his owner or pay the consequences...

## Description
My first foray into the world of game development, Unity and C#, **Pet the Dog** is my very first personal project seen to completion.
It features hand drawn art, dynamic instance generation and a loving dog. I created this project as a gift for my SO (spoiler alert: she loved it!).

## Features
* Wacky, stretchy arms (generated through dynamic instances and a lot of math)
* Hand-drawn art
* A loving dog

## Results
This project introduced me to both the Unity design pattern and C#. While there's a lot that could have been improved--like the fact that I have over 5 GameObjects just to handle the 'squiggly arm' interaction--Pet the Dog is still pretty rad. Even with zero game development knowledge, I can make something that works and that people love.
